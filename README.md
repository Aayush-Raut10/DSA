## Data structure
  Data structure is a way of storing and orgnizing data in computer's memory so that it can be easily and efficiently accessed.<br>
  Basically, Data structures are divided into two categories: linear and non-linear.<br>
  ### linear Data Structure
  Linear data structure is a type of data structure in which data elements are arranged linearly.some most common linear data structures are: <br>
  #### Arrays
    Array is a data structure used for storing data of the same type

  ### non-linear Data Structure
